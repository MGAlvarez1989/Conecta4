# Conecta4

This repo was created to solve MoureDev monthly challenges (https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022).

## Challenge Requirements

- 7x6 Board (7 in the "x" axis and 7 in the "y" axis).
- Red and yellow player. First player to start is red.
- There's no need to implement a functionality to play against the App. We assume that two people will play with each other.
- At column selection the token will be put at the bottom.
- Save the number of games won for each player while the App is running.
- Two buttons to restart the match and reset the counter.
- You can add every extra functionality considered.
